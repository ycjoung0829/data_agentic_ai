# Agentic AI systems #

## Context
There are many unstructured datasets, such as logs, raw image datasets, that do not provide useful relationships among metadata. By providing a data transformation AI, we can provide insights to the datasets that were not available before. 

## Solution
- Develop a dataset transformation AI that transforms raw data into structured and usable formats
- AI Agents
- Data Analysis Agent (analyzes the data and keeps track of the analysis)
- Database Schema Agent (determines the most relevant schema for the dataset)
- Database transformation Agent (converts unstructured data into a structured format)
- Chat Agent (provides interactive querying for users)
- May involve HITL (Human-In-The-Loop) with desired columns as user input

## Technologies
- LLM: OpenAI, Deepseek, Llama
- VLM: OpenAI Vision, Azure Computer Vision 
- LangChain
- Relational DBMS
